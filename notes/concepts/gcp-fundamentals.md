# GCP Fundamentals

## Overview
Google Cloud Platform (GCP) is a suite of cloud computing services that runs on the same infrastructure that Google uses internally for its end-user products.

## Key Concepts

### Cloud Computing Models
- **Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS)**: Virtual machines, storage, networking
- **Platform as a Service (PaaS)**: Application hosting and development platforms
- **Software as a Service (SaaS)**: Ready-to-use applications

### GCP Service Categories
1. **Compute**: Virtual machines, containers, serverless functions
2. **Storage**: Object storage, databases, file systems
3. **Networking**: Virtual networks, load balancing, CDN
4. **Big Data**: Data processing, analytics, machine learning
5. **Security**: Identity management, encryption, compliance
6. **Management**: Monitoring, logging, deployment tools

### Core GCP Concepts
- **Projects**: Top-level organizational unit
- **Resources**: Individual cloud resources (VMs, databases, etc.)
- **Billing**: Cost tracking and management
- **IAM**: Identity and Access Management
- **Regions and Zones**: Geographic distribution of resources

## Use Cases
- Web application hosting
- Data analytics and processing
- Machine learning and AI
- IoT applications
- Mobile app backends
- Enterprise solutions

## Implementation
1. Create a GCP project
2. Enable required APIs
3. Set up billing
4. Configure IAM
5. Deploy resources
6. Monitor and manage

## Best Practices
- Use resource naming conventions
- Implement proper IAM policies
- Monitor costs and usage
- Follow security best practices
- Use multiple regions for availability
- Implement backup and disaster recovery

## Common Issues
- **Billing surprises**: Monitor usage and set up alerts
- **Permission errors**: Check IAM roles and policies
- **Resource limits**: Understand quotas and request increases
- **Network connectivity**: Configure VPC and firewall rules
