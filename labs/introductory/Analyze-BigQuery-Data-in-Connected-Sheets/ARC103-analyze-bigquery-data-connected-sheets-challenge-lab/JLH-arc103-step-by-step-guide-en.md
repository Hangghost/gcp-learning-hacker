## Task 3: Create Pie Chart to Show Payment Type Distribution

### Step Details
1. **Return to original data sheet**
   - Switch back to the `tlc_yellow_trips_2022` sheet

2. **Create pie chart**
   - Click the **Chart** button in the spreadsheet
   - Select **New Sheet** and click **Create**
   - In Chart editor, select **Pie chart** as the chart type

3. **Set up chart data**

   - Select the following fields:
     - `pickup_datetime`
     - `dropoff_datetime`
     - `trip_distance`
     - `fare_amount`

3. **Set sorting options**
   - In the **Sort** section, click **Add**
   - Select the `trip_distance` field
   - Choose **Desc** (descending order)

4. **Set row limit**
   - Set **Row limit** to **10000** (extract 10,000 rows)

5. **Execute data extraction**
   - Click **Apply** to start data extraction

### Verification Steps
- Confirm successful extraction of 10,000 rows of data
- Verify data is sorted by trip distance in descending order
- Confirm all specified fields are included
- Click **Check my progress** to verify Task 4
