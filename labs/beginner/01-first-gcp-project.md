## Lab Steps

### Step 1: Access Google Cloud Console
1. Open your web browser

3. Sign in with your Google account

### Step 2: Create a New Project

2. Click "New Project"
3. Enter a project name (e.g., "my-first-gcp-project")
4. Select your organization (if applicable)
5. Click "Create"

### Step 3: Verify Project Creation
1. Wait for the project to be created
2. Verify the project appears in the project dropdown
3. Select your new project

### Step 4: Explore Project Settings
1. Navigate to "IAM & Admin" > "Settings"
2. Review the project details
3. Note the Project ID (automatically generated)

## Verification
- [ ] Project created successfully
- [ ] Project appears in project dropdown
- [ ] Project ID is visible and unique
- [ ] Project settings accessible

## Troubleshooting
- **Project creation fails**: Check if you have the necessary permissions
- **Project name already exists**: Try a different name or add numbers/suffix
- **Billing not enabled**: You may need to enable billing for some services

## Cleanup
This lab doesn't create billable resources, but you can:
1. Delete the project if it's no longer needed
2. Go to "IAM & Admin" > "Settings"
3. Click "Delete Project"
